===========

This set of scripts enables a simple sync of a foldertree (with the files of course) if the source and the destination are not accessible at the same time.
This can be if, e.g.,
* you are on journy with your laptop and have no internet connection
* you only have limited internet bandwidth 
* ...

In either case you need a "find ." dump of your destination filesystem and an moveable temp-directory (e.g. on an external harddisk or an thumbdrive).
